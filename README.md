Aspergillus flavus is a toxigenic fungus that can infect grains before and after harvest in hot and humid areas, producing a potent carcinogen know as aflatoxin. Using the ABM software NetLogo, we model the infection and growth of A. flavus in a peanut field over a growing season and the contamination of peanut kernels due to aflatoxins.

The deterministic variables and relationships of this model were inspired by the following papers. They can be further reviewed by those interested in improving the parameters of the model.
